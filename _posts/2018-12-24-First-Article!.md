#Hello All!

---

I'd just like to start out with the disclaimer that anything on this blog is intended for educational purposes only, if it deals with cybersecurity or penetration testing, I don't advocate anyone to take anything from this blog and potentially bring harm or misfortunate to anyone. That being said, I do not take responsability for any of your actions, only know that I do not advocate for anything negative or harmful. I understand that you have agency, and I can't override this agency, but just know that if you blame me or cite me as your influence, note that I specifically said not to do this.

That being said, I think we get started with a few favorite tools of mine:

* Kali Linux, Ubuntu 16.04, and Black Arch
* macchanger
* the Raspberry Pi 3
* Visual Code Studio
* Deathgrips and Tool
