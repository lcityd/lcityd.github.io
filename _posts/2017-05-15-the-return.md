## A  Little Wake Up Time ##
So, as you may have noticed, I have not posted much in the past week. Now, I can explain this quite nicely, and that is that I have been scavenging for a new place to call my labratory. Now, as a salvager, I find that I need to be very picky on the places within my house that I pick.

## Now we get into it ##

Now this does not mean I am homeless, as I just said, I have a house, I live in said house, and also eat in such house.
Now, as such, I have found a place, but that place is also very inconvonient. Another problem, security. As anyone who follows some of the stuff I do, you can tell that my set up for my entire labratory, computers, salvaging gear, self made weapons, etc. tend to be very expensive, and I have calculated the cost of all my equipment as high as many thousands of dollars. Now for reasons obvious, I won't be posted the exact value online.

So my solution would have been to perhaps rig traps all around the new cave.

Until then, keep building
