## First; Some Apologies ##
I know that I haven't been posting recently, and I have a very good explanation for that, and it's called school,
next software release, and a combination of other extracurricular activities (Track, weights, ETC.)
So, without further hesitation, I present to you
# Paragon! #
## But what is Paragon? ##
Good question! Paragon aims to be the first fully open sourced linux assistant. Everything from the neural networks
to the front end graphical interface has so far been the biggest struggle, which means that everything has been a sort 
of struggle. As a single developer (hope I get more), this has been a challange to produce, especially considering I entered
with absolutely no knowledge of programming languages apart from Basic and Fortran, and those were strictly for scripting or
mathematics related. 

## What does this mean for us? ##
You, the consumer, have the ability to now have a personal assistant on your own linux desktop. Entirely community contributed.
it also means you can be involved with the devving process. 

I plan to have this released within a month, however, I recently landed a full time summer job, which will pay for new computers
and other things, which you'll soon see coming to the blog as well :)

Stay Hacky,
Klaminite
