## Precursor

I understand I'm late to the party on this one, by a matter of 5-6 months to be precise, however, the song remains the same, and that's why I've decided to write about my concerns. While this article will maintain an unbaised and objective tone, I will post an editorial at the end of it, so if you already know what net neutrality is, both parties arguements, including those who remain neutral, then just spam your spacebar or scroll down. For those of you who wish to learn, then proceed down below, and try not to skip over anything. For any corrections/errors that can be revised, email me, include a name you want to be presented with the "edited by" (optional), along with the error AND THE CORRECT REVISION WITH SOURCES TO PROVE. There will be three parts to this article:
* The history (1960's, -10 years from today)
* The present (+- 10 years)
* the future  (10 years from today, Entropy)

## Enter: The Internet

The internet is, without any objection, one of the most innovative additions to humanities resources since the invention of the steam engine. From it, it has sprouted global economies, new-age encrypted currencies, boosted the active participation in stocks and global trading systems, improved the rate of production, and overall increased the standard of living.

It should be neccesary to start from the beginning. We observe two gentlemen, Paul Baran and Donald Davies. What they were working on was a subject called packet switching for networks of computers. This led to the inception of our everyday TCP packet, or UDP packet. It's not important or vital to the article what a [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) or [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol)  packet exactly is, however I have made them hyper links for those looking for better understanding. One of their networks was a network known as ARPANET, which would soon be platformed on fifteen total university and private locations by the end of 1971.

1973 brought about the succsessful satallite link from the Tanum Earth Station to Peter Kirsteins research group in the UK, now situtated at the University College London. Fast foward to 1982, both the popular term "_internet_" and the Internet Protocol Suite (IPS) TCP/IP were officially recognized as standard. This allowed networks similar to ARPANET to disperse and populate the globe.

Commercially, the story officially starts in 1989 with MCI mail and Compuserve's email capabilities to the 500,000 members of the internet. Then, in 1990, PSInet launches an alternative platform for commercial distribution/useage, one that will serve the commercial internet backbone to this date. In that same year, the first high speed T1 link averaging 1.5 megabits per second is installed Cornell University and CERN. This marked the beginning of the end for satallite communication. Six months following the first link, Tim Berners-Lee begins work on the first web browser, titled the WorldWideWeb. By christmas of that same year Tim had built all the tools in for the WorldWideWeb, HTTP 0.9, The Hypertext Markup Language, the browser itself, and the first web pages. 

Everything after this is comparable to opening a can of soda that's been shaked, some estimations regarding the growth of internet traffic claims that the traffic grows at a rate of 100 percent a year, while the mean number of users annually was thought to be between 20 and 50 percent.

List of Companies/Sites that started in the 1990s : 
* Netscape (which moulded into the form of mozilla thanks to open source code)
* Angelfire 
* Ebay
* Amazon 
* WebMD 
* Many of the goverment operated websites (Whitehouse.gov)
* Internet Underground Music Archive
* Internet Movie Database (IMDB)
* Popular magazine and newsite Wired.com
* MIT Campus newspaper _The Tech_.
* Prominent Financial Portfolio website _Bloomberg_.
* Widely accepted encyclopedia _Enclycopedia Britannica_.
* Popular search engine rival to Google and Microsoft Bing, Yahoo.com.
* GeoCities
* Prodigy (Owned by IBM and Sears)
* Ask Jeeves (Now Ask.com)

List of companies utilizing the web in the 1990's:

* Microsoft
* Apple
* IBM
* Intel
* CompuServe
* Sears

In the 2000's the internet truely became a monolithic powerhouse of innovation, creativity, and a well of inspiration. Breeding corporatate giants such as Facebook, Google, and Microsun. Microsoft windows releases windows 2000 in 2000, followed later in september of that year with Windows ME. AMD and Intel both release chips clocked to one gigahertz each. Sony releases the famed play station two. Mac OSX is released in march of 2001, three months after the Mac OSX release, Linux kernal version 2.4.0 is released. Followed in suite with xbox released at the end of the year. In total, the 2000's is the golden age of technological innovation from big corporations.

Between 2000 and 2007, internet broadband usage had hit 80 percent, leading to broadband becoming a standard for quality internet. Music sales and downloads followed suite, leading to new compression and encoding algorithms, the inception of apple ipod. Due to popular usage, "_google_" is officially recognized as a verb. Open source software becomes more and more abundant, leading to the rise in popularity of open source operating systems such as FreeBSD and Linux. By 2004, the video games industry profit had surpassed that of the movie industry. Youtube was created, in part because of adobe flash's increasingly powerful capabilities.

Things are looking good for the computer and the internet.

## The Present (2007-2017)

In this section we will observe the increase in the progress of humanity based off a free and open internet, declare the rules and protections that Net Neutrality imposes on us, and the arguements both for and against, devoid of opinion. During this time, many of the most groundbreaking innovations occur in that of artificial intelligence, robotics, web server development, data sciences, IT, and many of the other fields of communications that would be too abudnant to list. This is in part because there is access to open source software, allowing authors to contribute and improve already existing libraries and software. Another part is the fact that databases, normally considered free by the authors themselves, aren't charging users money to allow them to be an operable unit.

### What Does Net Neutrality Say?:
Allow the [document](https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0312/FCC-15-24A1.pdf) itself to do the speaking

#### Arguements for Net Neutrality:

The arguements for net neutrality state that the ideas and princaples of a free and open net is one that is devoid of corporate greed and tampering, be it for extra money in exchange for faster services, or for extra money for services normally taken for granted today. Here is a list of the ideas that those who support net neutrality present:
* Protects freedom of Speech and Press along with in certain cases assembly
* Allows sites to load faster
* Prevents a monopoly of private companies from taking over
* Keeps the internet just and fair when it comes to data transfer
* A repeal would encourage further consolidation.

For point one, an example can be presented that goes as follows: Imagine that you were using comcast, a supporter of a candidate you didn't support, any website speaking against that candidate that comcast supports can now be censored. Anything from blog posts debunking and proving points against a canidate, all the way up to major news outlets such as _Washington Post_, or _MSNBC_, or _Fox News_. 

For point two, an example can be presented as follows: Given a smaller company with no real income, and given a larger company that presents a majority of profit, comcast or AT&T could favor the larger company, simply due to the fact that there is more money to gain. This pushes the smaller business 

For point three, an example can be presented as follows: Imagine that a new internet service provider were to come onto the scene. It almost instantly is going to lose every single deal, simply in part because of the idea that the person who arrives first onto a scene and lays cables, they now own and control those cables.

For point four, a situation can be drawn up as: Imagine that you are a lower paying consumer, incapable of paying three hundred dollars a month for premium internet, you will now have capped data for those that do pay for those levels of speed from the internet.

For point 5, see source 3.

##### Arguements against Network Neutrality

The arguements against net neutrality are in opposite to that of those who want to keep, and are generally based off the grounds of ease, practicality, and big corporations. As a note, few arguements are presented on the opposing side, which is why there are fewer then the previous segments.

* "First of all, the current regulation is an example of the 'kind of lawlessness that ran in the Obama administration.'”
* "True net neutrality can't be achieved."
* "The solution is searching for a problem"

For all three cases, I recommend attending the third source listed, as they play devils advocate better then I would, and give a more fair representation of the side.

###### Arguements for neither side

In many cases, there will always be a neutral party. One that does not enjoy the dog fighting the two primary sides are commiting against each other. In many scenarios, these are voters who will not vote at all, or critics that don't take a stance for one movement or the other, but rather just enjoy the wealth of content that both sides bring in.

* don't use the internet enough to warrent a purchase from an ISP.
* don't understand the full weight of the situation at hand.
* don't find it an issue worth fighting.

In many cases, people in more rural/agricultural areas of the country do not use nor need the internet. 

Most people, be it due to working long shifts or just not having the time, nor never even hearing about net neutrality and the fight against the FCC, will not understand the consequences that this will bring without reading into it.

Most people who simply do not need the internet will find it a useless point for them to fight for, as it doesn't directly affect them.

## The Future (OP ED)

   Some can make the claim that, before this year, the future was looking bright for the internet. Artificial intelligence and robotics were reaching peaks of innovation. Generative Adversial Networks is harolded as this decades most influential work on artificial intelligence, and the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) is sourced well over 1000 times. If I was asked back in 2007, when I first recieved my dell laptop that my was my fathers old work computer, and began writing batch scripts and visual basic. Most of the material that I've used in my quest to learn programming languages have been from the internet. Most of the bug fixes and security patches that I've used have also been found on the internet. Suppose I can no longer pay for these, I am no longer able to make open source secure software. Imagine how big of a hit the IT industry would take if people just stopped learning on their own and entering the field, getting certified. 
   
   Another point that can be made is one that counters the idea that restricting what the big corporations can do also in turn restricts the free market. I can't disagree more. This point is very contradictary, even if you assume that the big corporations will play nicely and allow small businesses to grow and expand, which they won't, people will still go to the bigger corporations just because of their reputation and reliability. If I was a first time internet user, I would go for the big name companies simply because I've heard of them more often. Another thing to note, religious, political, and certain social groups can be censored and even blacklisted from many social media sites, preventing a free opinion and expression. For example, conservatives, whilst you may not agree with them, still deserve the same grounds of speaking that anyone else does. Freedom of speech does not have an inherit "spectrum" or "allowance" on it, however that's a topic for another day.
   
   It's also worth noting that the current statistics of people who know about net neutrality, **98 percent** of them support **KEEPING** net neutrality. If, on december 14th, net neutrality is not kept safe, imagine the backlash from the general populus that not only the fcc would recieve, but also the united states goverment, as if the current backlash wasn't enough. Many of my relatives and friends have stated that they would indeed protest if the repeal is actually gone through with. Another point to  address is the crowds that are resilent on remaining neutral, or having an opinion and not speaking up about it. This is not something that affects just internet users. Businesses and the economic tractor **THRIVE** off of a free and open internet. Many independent stock traders and cryptocurrencies run off the basis of a free and open internet. In fact, as of recent, bitcoin ($BTC) had recently hit $11k. Now imagine if net neutrality wasn't a thing, and comcast decided to block bitcoin because it did not agree with it as a viable replacement for the united states dollar.
   
   Overall, I find it really low how FCC is supposed to be the one fighting the corporations, not caving into them. FCC board, if you're reading this, I hope you understand that in the future, no one will thank you for this, because no one will be able to communicate for under $30. Knowledge should not be something that you get to charge an arm and a leg for, more or less charge anyone who pays close to $200 a month MORE on top of that just so they can watch a few youtube videos.

   I hope today I managed to inform, and challange or support those who are arguing against, and for, net neutrality. In the end, december 14th, the day that freedom online could very well end, is approaching fast. I advise those who want to do something, but don't know where to start, to start here:

>"Ajit Pai, former Verizon lawyer and current chairman of the FCC, is expected to circulate the text of his rule and announce a vote to gut net neutrality protections on November 22, the day before Thanksgiving.
> Once the FCC announces a vote (which would likely be at its open meeting in December), it will become much, much harder to stop them from gutting the rules that prevent companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T from charging us all extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling, blocking, and censoring websites, apps, games, and streaming services.

>The good news is that we are hearing from people who are meeting with Congress that there are key lawmakers who are sympathetic to the cause, and considering stepping in to slow down the FCC. But they need to be getting a lot more phone calls from constituents in order to act."
