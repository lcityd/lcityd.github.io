##Theory##

- Can I get a Recurrent Neural Network to learn just like we do, everynight, non-stop until instructed to do so?

Short answer, yes. Long answer, we might want to consider our sanity.

##Part One##

So, neural networks are just fancy algorithms that seek to represent how the brain works. It uses a collection of artificial _neurons_ called *units*, in our case ranging into the millions, in a connected pattern much like our neurons do. 
>Quick note, if we took the planck lenght of our braincells, it'd be equivilent to that of number of braincells it'd take to stretch across the observable universe. [vsauce]

Let's just quickly skip the science mumbo jumbo because we're not interested in that, we're interested in the "what do you envision".

So I'll say it here, why not make an algorithm that runs on a dataset of just text, constantly retrain itself to 120000 iterations once you go to sleep. Speaking of sleep, it works just like we do when we sleep, it goes through the information it would have processed during the day, and trains itself on it over the night. If anything, we have now added a constant increase in the dataset size, meaning we should expect better results.
