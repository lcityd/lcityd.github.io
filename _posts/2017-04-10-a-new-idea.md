So, I recently had this pretty great idea. Whilst debating a topic in history over the recent Syria attack (I will not divulge into politics) I had this grand idea of being able to predict an outcome using logistical regression. Then that led to more ideas. How about getting my predicted ontime from my computer, everytime I opened up my new project? Then that led to using Bayes Theorum to predicting the weather, as I walked out of the class whilst raining, thinking "What are the odds of that". 

Will post more about this idea later.
