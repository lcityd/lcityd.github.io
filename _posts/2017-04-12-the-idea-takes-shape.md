##The Idea Takes Shape

The other day I posted about this recent idea I had, well, it appears, my determination has set that idea in motion. I have drafted computer designs, and in all honesty, I have been working on the skelaton of this 'system' a year ago. It is finally time to finish this system, and while it will be used extensively in research zones, I doubt it will even be noticed or cause that much of an impact  to the scientific computing community, of which I have been apart of for the past year. I will inform about my progress tommorow, but in the meantime, I will begin uploading images of the results. The recurrent neural network for basic conversations and small talk has been trained, and will be set to train for a certain period of time whilst I am at school.

Until next time, I will post more.
