So, I finally went and installed gentoo, although it wasn't the authentic gentoo install, because cloveros from our good friends over at /g/ exists, so I downloaded that, used the ubuntu 18.04 iso burner, burned it to my working flash drive, and off I went

Of course I'm going to have to git clone my repos now, and resinstall wine and stuff

but yea, its pretty good so far, far outperforms every other distro.
