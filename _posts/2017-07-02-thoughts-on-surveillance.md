## Surveillence::A Prologue
So, I'm sure a lot of people who are reading this probably already know that this data is being logged to every agency the united states has. Everything from the slight change in voltage required to view this page with your hardware, the lights you use, the stove you turn on, the words you speak, the people you know, the places you go, the actions you do, it's all being logged to the NSA/CIA under the patriot act. I know that some people agree with the patriot act, I know my parents are two of such people, they believe that if the patriot act is to do more good then harm then it has no problem being there. What they don't realize, and I'll point this out, is that it does more harm then good, in fact, all it's done is harm. I'll point out places where the NSA/CIA/FBI knew about 'terrorists plots' and never took action, and in places where it simply wouldn't work. I've decided to make this a series of posts, which when I feel like it, will later translate into a set of videos on youtube. My entire goal of this is to bring people into the light of mass surveillance, and why you need to fight against it. Stop using their products, their landlines, stop using their servers. This series will focus on 6 key parts: The Origins, What it means legally, what can happen to you, why you should fight against it, how you can stop it, what it can do if left unchecked


## Chapter 1:: The Origins and Who to Blame.

It may help to understand the psychology of people before we embark on blaming them for passing legistlative orwellian bills, and to do that, we need to travel back centuries. To the age of which there was no patriot act, computers, or even electricity. This time will be known as the pre-modern era, as most things in history would be seen as. We must understand first that humans have always had a tendency to snap. You can be a pacifist all you want, war and violence will always be present, it can be minimized, but there will always be conflict. One person will want what the other person has, and that will lead to conflict. There is no ultimate peace, no global power, no ruling dictator. 

In this age we observe the Roman Empire, power hungry, near the end of it's days, and corrupt. We observe that friends turn to enemies, and murder fellow humans out of pure greed, conflict. We find that no two people can fully trust each other, the death of an empire. The goverment continues to take over, no longer being a republic, but an authoritarian dictatorship, with the man at the top, knowing what happens at all times.f

Fast foward a few centuries, another great empire is birthed, from the sole idea that with a single ruler at the top there is always a tyranny, be it you're affected or not. This great empire, America, was founded on the ideas that goverment shall never become big enough, but just act as a "Neccesary Evil" as George Washington put it.

You may be pondering where this is heading, and I must explain again that we are building up to the current age, everything so far has happened in a blink of an eye, a mere blip, a tap, a thin slice in the massive cake of time. I've defined the fall of Rome, and the Rise of America. Any history buffs will know that one of Romes primary reasons for falling was political instability and corruption, much like what America today is facing. 

Fast foward to the 1990's, the [1993 WTC Bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing)
occurs, while many politically right people will notice the trend in beliefs, many left political people will notice the trend in 'anti-isam'. I will take no stance in this series on either political platforms in the case of faith being a motive or not in terrorist attacks. What should be noted is that this is one of the few terrorist attacks that will serve as the breeding grounds for one of the most careless legislative bills in history. 
2001, a year many remember the date of September 11th, when I was only one year old. The year the world changed, for the better or worse is to be argued, but it was changed. Introduce the [Patriot Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act). For starts, click that link, read up on it, if you notice, the first thing on the right you will notice under long title, is that it say
>An Act to deter an d punish terrorist acts in the United States and around the world, to enhance law enforcement investigatory tools, and for other purposes.

look a bit closer


>*and for other purposes.*

It was here that congress and the senate pass this bill, the first year after the turn of the century and we are already potentially losing it, because once again, corrupted goverment officials want to abuse legislation andcan you guess what those other purposes are? 

Welcome to the new age.
