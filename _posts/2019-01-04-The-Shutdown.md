Hello All!

    So as you all know, we've been experiencing a government shutdown for the past two weeks, and if I have anything worth mentioning, I don't believe it is going to end anytime soon. As we already know, the democratic house officials were sworn in, and have already attempted to come to a compromise with Donald Trump, however, it seems as if Donald Trump wants to be stubborn. My guess is, he wants to try and show that he isn't going to "compromise with the dirty demoncrats," even though he has done so in the past numerous times.
    
    Another thing worth mentioning, is the strategic position the democrats have Trump in right now. The current dilema can be visualized as such:

        - Trump wants border wall;
        - Trump, through procrastination, has put off said border wall until now (we can get to what this could have been an attempt at later)
        - Budget funding for 5 billion dollars for wall (much lower than the original ~20 billion that was requested to begin with) is blocked
        - Trump and congress disagreeing lead to partial shutdown
        - Trump, presented with a compromise of 1.7 billion, refuses.
  
    Although this is just an outline of the current situation, what can happen, or could be happening, is that the democrats are going to not budge, and historically congress has won these scenarios, Trump will either keep the house shutdown, or fold. Either way, he has shown that his entire campaign promise is backed into a corner with no way out. He promised to both build the wall, and that this wall would be a great big wall, and that this wall would be... etc.
    If he can't follow through on these promises, his campaign is screwed for a 2020 reelection, assuming all other things are going smooth for him by that point. If he compromises, he loses, again, a significant chunk of his voter base, as it reminds them that he is just another cog.

    #### How does that affect any of us?

    First, I would like to bring into the light some quick facts about who, and what, is on the government payroll:
        - The TSA
        - The IRS
        - Parks and Recreation
