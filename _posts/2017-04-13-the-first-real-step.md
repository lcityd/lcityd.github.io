## The Idea for Everest ( Or since, I have now decided to make it commercially availabble, the Machine for my terms.

So, essentially, tonight I finished both extra credit math homework, and my facial identification system for the machine. However, it could still use some tuning up, especially with all the bugs and glitches in it. I will attempt to make the final version completely bug free, but there is absolutely no guarantee that will occur. 

So thing's we still have on our milestone to a personal assistant
1.) Attempt to bridge the gap between versioned software IE the python seq2seq model that we retrieve our generated messages from, and the python3 skeleton system
2.) Apply bayesian theorum to predict numerical and observable events
3.) apply classification algorithms for special things
4.) Begin constructing the sentiment analysis, also to be stored in the same "bridge"

What I am proposing here, is that we can have infinitely many neural networks, bridged by a certain unified code language, that can also act as a temporal memory.

This theory will be posted about friday, as it is then that I decide to celebrate the official one year anniversary of Everest, and more importantly, the machine.
