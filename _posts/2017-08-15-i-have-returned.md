# I have returned!

So, I know it's been a bit of time (_a month_) since I posted on here, and I know that I was starting a new series of blog posts on mass survelliance and the arguements both for and against it, (_which will be resumed in a week or so don't worry_); however, I became caught up with life, my job started to become more demanding as we're gearing up for the school year (_I work for my school, easy summer money and it's what paid for the rig and most of my upcoming projects_). Without further a due, I must present what I have been working on in the mean time:

> A new utility glove (SAKI mk 1) using the pi 3 (__Tutorial soon__)
> Assembly and C tutorials and projects coming soon (Working on a backend for my cluster based assistant)
> An automated drone (__maybe tutorial?__)
> A final salute to my power gloves (__Tutorial definitely__)

and of course, the planning of my new, essentially rebuilt, cluster system, Paragon MK 2, which will come next summer or whenever I manage to get $2,000.

I just want to say that I am incredibly sorry for not being able to upload in the past month, like I said, I've become incredibly bogged down by stuff outside of the wild west we call the internet.

until next time
