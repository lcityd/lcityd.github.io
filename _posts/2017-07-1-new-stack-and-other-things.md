So, I know I haven't posted in a while, and again, for good reason. You probably noticed this blog is now hosted on a second site apart from github, and I recently asked a friend to help me with hosting this until I can buy the new computers for a new cluster. I've attached links below if you want to see/buy your own. I'm also working full time now to support my addictive habits of buying computers.

Along with that there is also now an exchange student staying in my residence as well, so perhaps time isn't the most plentiful of resources right now.

Perhaps if I went outside a bit?...
