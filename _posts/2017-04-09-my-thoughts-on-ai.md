So, as I currently understand it, many people tend to be more concerned with Artificial Intelligence (AI), rather then be more concerned on what we've achieved so far. And let me tell you, if we were to take what we currently have into account so far, we would have very little to be concerned about. Peoples fears tend to be of irrational, unexplainable things, such as spiders, why are we REALLY afraid of spiders? However, I believe the issue stems more from the cloud of darkness that holywood has cast over the realms of Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning. Terminator, no matter how much you believe it will happen, won't happen. It just isn't plausable. It's like saying you bet your life savings on you getting into a car crash tommorow. Not impossible, but it's so statistically low that it might as well as be considered impossible for practicalities sake. 

## 1.) AI can drive cars though?
Yes, terribly might I add. We still far surpass computers in the realms of basic cognitive functions. The only thing they beat us at is speed, and that's been known for a while. Man, even my toaster is faster then I am sometimes. 

## 2.) But what about smart guns?

You mean the product that never hit resell? You mean the product that's only goal was to take more money from the consumers in the weapons industries? That was doomed from start, and no, artificial intelligence never had even a remotely key play in that gun, apart from perhaps the automation lines.

## 3.) Speaking of automation lines, what about the idea of factories not having as many human interactions anymore? It's all robotic?

Yes, but do we have a robot doing quality assurance of your volkswagon? No. And for obvious reasons, some can say that while artificial intelligence (really just neural networks) have indeed gotten more advanced in image recognition, we still lead in the realms of making smart, precise, decisions that ultimately could cost a manufactor thousands upon thousands at the end of the day, or not. 

## 4.) But you talked about image recognition, that's pretty advanced? Right?

Actually no. It's nothing we can't do, in fact our brain is more then capable of applying a filter everytime we look at something, open our eyes, just about anything with our optical system, your brain has to translate that image from it's original inverted form (upside down), to it's "regular form", it also has a way of blurring out mistakes before you even know about it. For example, Look left, then right, notice how you should have seen EVERYTHING in between? Well, your brain automatically cuts out whats in between. 

## 5.) What if this AI could make more AI? What if it makes an army of...

Evil warmongering titanium plated aluminium coated robotic bringers of death? Nice try, but this is the age old idea that if we make one AI, chances are it will make more, and more, because thats what it observed us doing. Theres a very simple solution to this, and it's called root access, and airgapping. If the AI can't get access and control of its own host system, theres nothing more it can do. CAn edit VERY basic files, as in your eight year old's school research report, but beyond that, it's helpless. Topple that on with airgapping the unit it's in, and theres no way for it to clone tiself. 

Also, if you think about it, we ourselves, create intelligence. We are the very byproduct of someone making intelligence. And (((hopefully))) no one has gone on a murderous rampage.
