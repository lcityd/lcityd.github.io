## Hello Everyone 

Just wanted to let everyone know that I will be releasing my operating system this friday, and while it won't be the best of the best,it certainly will be good. As with every major software release, it's common to give a list of features to expect in the release to potential users, so here it goes:

* Encrypted home directories
  - Documents, pictures, everything will be encrypted, keeping you in, and the bad guys out!
* Logical Volume Management
  - Tired of a corrupt root directory deleting photos? Worry no longer! With logical volume management, if one part fails, the rest stays nice and tidy!
*Tired of Google leeching on your information? 
  - Comes with TOR! Tor is a private web browser that works like a vpn, but in a web browser!
* Modern UI
* Perhaps you fancy games?
  - Discord, IRC, Wine and Steam come built in!
* Are you a scientist? 
  - Comes with majority of python scientific modules built in!
* Developer perhaps? 
  - comes with Eclipse oxygen built in as well! Both java and C++/C are supported!

I'll add more to the operating system, or remove if people want to sift through bloatware, later! Along with that, I'll be figuring out how to install it on a hard drive, I've seen people manage to do it, I just need to figure out how.

Along with that, send any bugs or really crucial stuff to klaminite2000@gmail.com (business email), or for inquiries or opportunities.
Thanks!
